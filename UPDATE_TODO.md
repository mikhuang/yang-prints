Tags: 3 policies, policy overview, 4-per-sheet, ganged
Notes: can you please make a version without the hashtags, to look more professional? perhaps include a small list of policies in its place (1 democracy dollars, 2 etc) The resolution looks to be low from the jpg, 742 x 960, will it print blurry?

Notes: I love the credit card idea! Can we get one with a blue front so it's recognizable using the same color scheme as the rest of the campaign? I want to start leaving them behind in restaurants along with my tip!

Notes: Can you make a PDF version? This would be better for high quality print. Also, please make a B&W version? (Or at least make the background white.) It would be more affordable to print for the average low income supporter while canvassing. Thank you! - Chen
